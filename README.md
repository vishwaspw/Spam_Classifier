Certainly, here are the step-by-step instructions for setting up and running the application using a virtual environment for Python 3.9:

1. **Setup Virtual Environment**:
   - Open the terminal.
   - Install the virtual environment package if you haven't already: `conda create -p venv python=3.9 -y`.
   - Create a virtual environment: `virtualenv venv`.
   - Activate the virtual environment:
    conda activate venv/


2. **Install Requirements**:
   - Install the requirements: `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

3. **Set Up the Jupyter Notebook**:
   - Open the Jupyter Notebook in your virtual environment.
   - pip install ipykernel
   - pip install jupyter notebook

4. **Run Application.py**:
   -python appl.py

5. **Let's Deploy it at Render.com**:
   -go to this website: https://dashboard.render.com/web
   -then click on new and choose web serivces
   -choose this :Build and deploy from a Git repository and click on next
   -then in settings :![image](https://github.com/MasteriNeuron/Spam-Classifier/assets/127201746/7d0493d1-7e0a-46cb-b15e-e3f45f006d1d)


6. **So click on manual Deploy and select deploy with latest commit**

By following these steps, you can set up a virtual environment, install necessary requirements, and run the `app.py` script in the Jupyter Notebook environment. This process helps ensure a clean and isolated development environment for your application.

## Hurray Enjoy the code
